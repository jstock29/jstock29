# Hello!
I'm Jared. I currently work as a Senior Developer at Thoughtworks. Most of my work can't be shared publicly, but this is where I keep personal projects. You'll notice I have a problem where I impulse buy domains for my friends. Things might get weird. 


# My repos
## Arup Social Data
I lied! This is work I can share publicly!

I've been leading this pro-bono project at Arup to create an open database and code to help address the looming eviction crisis in the US. This initally started as a collaboration with New Story, an excellent charity who we worked with to help make decisions about direct payments to renters in the Bay Area. Since then, we've expanded the database and analysis to include over 40 datasets (over 2 million rows of data) from a variety of sources including the US Census, ACS, FRED, HUD, EPA, and more. I'm pretty proud of this project and hope that it can help some people. 

You can read all about the code and data at the [repository](https://github.com/arup-group/social-data). You can also check out the data using our fun new [Streamlit app!](https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py)

## Deal or No Deal
I contend that _Deal or No Deal_ is the greatest game show ever conceived. It's a fascinating window into what people value and the how we experience the collective enterprise of humanity itself. But that's not what this repository is all about. 

I'm interested in how the Banker works, so I decided to try to reverse engineer the Banker's algorithm. You can follow along with this full saga through [some articles I wrote on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-figured-out-how-deal-or-no-deal-works-kind-of-875e63a8cef6), but this repository is where I've been storing all of that code. I've been using Streamlit to build interfaces to help me collect data, vizualize trends, and build and test machine learning models to replicate the Banker. I also created [another Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/jstock29/dealnodeal/main/app.py) where you can see what different Bankers (read: machine learning models) will predict the offer will be for a given board. This app was actually a bit tricky to make because managing state in Steamlit isn't straightforward (just take a look at the url to see).

## Squirrel Attack
I made this for an interview where the team wanted me to just show something new that I haven't done before. I hadn't worked with native development at all, so decided to build a React Native app. I also wanted to show that I can work at all levels of the stack.

New York City's open data portal has a delightful dataset called the Central Park Squirrel Census. Over the summer of 2020, I spent a lot of time in Central Park with my friends, which revealed one of my friend's deep dislike of squirrels. This led to this app, which is a Squirrel Aggression Predictor. I made a small machine learning model trained on the CPSC (in a SQL database) and deployed that to an API endpoint. I then made my React Native frontend to allow someone to enter some information about a squirrel and get a prediction for whether that squirrel poses a threat (spoiler: they do not pose a threat). 

## Teetum.com
This is a [joke website](https://teetum.com/blog) I made for my friend Tatum's birthday. It's a parody of her blog, laden with jokes that will make no sense and pictures that straddle the line of postability. I debuted this at her spooky-themed birthday party and it's one of the best gifts I've ever given.

It's a pretty simple Angular app that I used to teach myself about deployment on AWS, https, and DNS management. I also designed this to work best on mobile but still be usable on a desktop. I also added a bunch of little easter eggs throughout and all of them will make no sense to almost anyone. 

## Bigballsannie.com
Ok yes, I know. The name. I think it would be better for both of us if you didn't ask. 

Otherwise, this is another joke website I made for my friend's birthday. You can visit this ridiculous site at [bigballsannie.com](https://bigballsannie.com/), but you'll have to answer a math problem to enter, because my friend loves math. This was designed _entirely_ for a mobile web user, so it will look a bit janky on a desktop. 

I took this project in a different artistic direction than the previous joke site I made. Due to my friend's obsession with Animal Crossing, I decided to turn this into a sort of playground with a Stonk Market game (based on Animal Crossing turnip-based Stalk Market), a bulletin board of embarassing pictures, and an endless math quiz.

## jaredstock.com
As one of the few domains I've bought for non-ridiculous reasons, this is [my personal site](https://jaredstock.com). I wanted this to be a showcase of stuff I've done, but also not feel like it came out of a SqareSpace template. I wanted this to be something only I would make. I agonized over pretty much everything: the speed of the scroll effect, the exact hex values of blue and yellow, the fonts (I love the header font and I'm not changing it), all the way down to details like the text selection color. I even tried to animate the logo to make it feel like breath, rather than just bobbing up and down. 

I'll never be fully happy with it, but I like where it is now, though I should add some easter eggs to it. 

## Interpolator
This is one of the very first projects I ever did. I made a really simple html and JavaScript interpolation calculator. This was a chance for me to learn about frontend web development and stumble way to deploying a real site. The site has long since vanished from the internet, but the code is still here for me look back at with a mix of pride and embarrassment. 

## Coursera
These are from an AngularJS course I did several years ago. Since AngularJS is now fully dead and buried, these aren't very useful to anyone.
